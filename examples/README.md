# Examples

For a basic bot, see [basic.py](basic.py). This accepts any gift offers received and shows the basic functions of all 
parts of this library.

For a bot that picks up everything emitted by the lib, see [receiver.py](receiver.py). This could be coded to send 
you notifications or something, but otherwise just shows everything emitted by the library.

For a bot that does some basic processing of each item to check if the trade is good, see [process.py](process.py). 
Please never actually use that as a bot though.


For more in-depth usage of this module you should look at some scripts that already exist and use it, such as 
[this](https://github.com/mninc/automatic-v2) project.
